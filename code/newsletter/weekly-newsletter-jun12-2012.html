													<p><strong>In  2010</strong>, Burberry  Group said it would buy out its Chinese franchises in a £70m deal that will see  it take direct control of its 50 stores on the mainland. Angela Ahrendts, chief  executive of Burberry said the Burberry brand had more global momentum than  ever in its history. It had the product innovation and supply chain to handle  the fastest-growing luxury market. &ldquo;Regardless of the market dynamics going on,  other dynamics are in place to make this the optimum time to do [this deal],&rdquo;  she said.</p>
                                                    <p>Burberry will pay  £70m from cash resources to end its franchise agreement and buy back the retail  properties from Kwok Hang Holdings, its Hong Kong-based master franchisee. The  stores are valued at £30m, and produced sales of about £75m last year, bringing  the group&rsquo;s existing franchisees annual operating profit of £14m. </p>
                                                    <p>Buying in the  franchise is expected to add £20m to operating profit in the 2011-12 year. The China stores are  spread across 30 cities in the mainland, including nine in Beijing and four in  Shanghai. Burberry has directly-owned stores elsewhere in the region, including  19 in Taiwan, 13 in Hong Kong and one in Macao.</p>
                                                  <p>Ms. Ahrendts said  another 10 stores were expected to be opened in China this year. &ldquo;In the next  couple of years we could have up to 100 stores in that market,&rdquo; she said. She  added that Burberry was particularly excited about China because a large part  of the country had a cold climate. &ldquo;We are an outerwear company. The  opportunity to leverage that category is huge.&rdquo; In addition, unlike in Japan,  the Chinese luxury market was largely dominated by male shoppers. </p>
                                                    <p><strong>From  the beginning of this year to March 31</strong>, Burberry revealed a 24pc rise in sales to  £1.9bn and a 24pc jump in pre-tax profits to £366m. Angela Ahrendts hailed the  period as &quot;another successful year&quot;, adding: &quot;An intense focus  by our global teams on business, brand and culture in recent years has resulted  in a strong foundation across channels, regions and products.&quot; </p>
                                                    <p>Burberry saw menswear  as a particular highlight, with new initiatives such as tailoring increasing  underlying growth in this area by 26pc. This represented 24pc of  retail/wholesale revenue. Sales of non-clothing  items for men jumped by more than 50pc, with growth seen in &quot;large leather  goods, small leather goods and soft accessories&quot;. </p>
                                                    <p>Jaana Jätyri, chief  executive of fashion trend forecaster Trendstop.com, said: &quot;Another bumper  set of results for Burberry, which has perfected democratic luxury brand  positioning. While positioned above the struggling high street, it is more  affordable and more accessible to aspirational buyers - democratic luxury is in  high demand.&quot; However, as budget-conscious shoppers keep a close eye on  spending, Ms. Ahrendts said she remained &quot;vigilant&quot; about the current  retail environment. </p>
                                                    <p>Burberry revealed  that its retail/wholesale operating margin will be lower in the six months to  September than in the same period last year, but expects this to recover in the  second half. The company opened 23  mainline stores and 25 concessions during the year, closing 10 and 16  respectively. It expects to open a net 15 stores in 2012/13. Growth in China,  where Burberry has 63 stores, was &quot;well over 20pc&quot;. However, it took  a £10.2m charge on a put option linked to the 2010 Chinese acquisitions. </p>
                                                    <p><strong>The  getchee Take</strong></p>
                                                    <p>In 2010, Burberry  made a 70 million pound purchase of its franchise business worth only 30  million pounds. That said a lot about Burberry&rsquo;s confidence for growth in the  Chinese market. At the time of purchase, Burberry had 50 stores in China. They  now have 63 stores. From Burberry financial report, in 2010, Asia Pacific revenue  was 282.7 million pounds. In 2012 (year to March), AP region reported 652.5  million pounds, their most profitable region.  </p>
                                                    <p>How will they further capture the male market in China? Will  Burberry reach their goal for 100 stores within the next few years? Will  Burberry continue to open stores by the coast, or will they expand more in <a href="http://www.getchee.com/data/china-insight.html?utm_source=getchee&utm_medium=newsletter&utm_campaign=weekly%2Bnewsletter%2Bjune%2B13%2B2012" target="_blank" style="color: #9CBD42; text-decoration: none;">tier  3 cities</a> like Chengdu and Wuhan?</p>

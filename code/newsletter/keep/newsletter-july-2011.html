But in the most populous country in the world, a fast-food giant stepped off the conveyor belt and found unprecedented success by being different, not by being the same.</span></td>

China succeeded and expanded by staying local on many levels. It keeps close ties to the Chinese government, hires local management, sources food from within the country, and changes the menu to suit Chinese tastes and style of eating.</td>

Because China is so big this has a huge impact on the rest of the global food system. What happens in China, what Chinese people eat, impacts what you and I pay for food.&quot;</td>

Brands, and with KFC in particular, had a lot to do with China division chairman and CEO Sam Su. &quot;He really flexed the model,&quot; says Shelman. This was in part due to KFC being owned by PepsiCo when it first came to China. PepsiCo was not a fast-food company, so Su was given more managerial freedom.</td>

            <p>&quot;There was huge camaraderie evident in the way that the top management team interacted with each other … they bantered back and forth and poked fun at each other,&quot; Shelman says. &quot;They'd be walking down the hall jostling, pushing, laughing. This is a group that has worked together a long time—unusual in a country where experienced management talent is at a premium.&quot;</p>
            <p>And so the employer-employee relationship has more a feel of family. &quot;In the United States, if you don't show up at work, what happens? You get fired,&quot; says Shelman. &quot;In China, where many of the company's 250,000 employees are college students working their first job, it's like, 'Oh we understand that sometimes you feel like skipping class. If you decide to skip work—please call in and let us know, so we can make sure your job is covered.'&quot;</p>
            <p>Trained labor, it turns out, is a very valuable asset even in a land of 1.3 billion-plus people.</p>

            <td>&nbsp;</td>
            <td align="left" valign="top" style="font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 12px; color: #999999; line-height: 18px; margin-top: 0px; margin-bottom: 18px;">
            <p>&quot;Chu's acceptance and appreciation for these young employees is exceptional for Western companies to see,&quot; says Shelman. Younger employees, for example, are encouraged to socialize over company-provided video games on their breaks. This practice serves several purposes: It eases the minds of parents anxious about sending their children out into the world, provides crucial social skills for young adults who grew up in single-child households, creates lifelong Yum! Brands customers, and develops a culture of customer service in a country where there was none.</p>
            <p>The restaurant management program is similarly focused. &quot;You're a college graduate,&quot; says Shelman. &quot;You're recruited for that position. You're very carefully developed to be able to do all these different jobs in the restaurant. And it's perceived as something that you would do your entire life.&quot;</p>

Brands to the menus in KFC restaurants. A small number of items would be familiar to Western visitors—mashed potatoes, corn on the cob, fried bone-in chicken—but most would not. The Chinese KFC menu may include fried dough sticks, egg tarts (which Shelman raves are &quot;to die for&quot;), shrimp burgers, and soymilk drinks, as well as foods tailored to the tastes of specific regions within China.</td>
